## This is WIP.

We use shadcdn/ui [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the UI components.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8322](http://localhost:8322) with your browser to see the result.
