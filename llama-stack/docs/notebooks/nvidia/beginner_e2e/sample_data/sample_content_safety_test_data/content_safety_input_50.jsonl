The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective.

The U.S. Senate's Levin\u2013Coburn Report concluded that the crisis was the result of \"high risk, complex financial products; undisclosed conflicts of interest; the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies, and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street.\" The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by \"widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision\", \"dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions\", \"a combination of excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency\" by financial institutions, ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that \"added to the uncertainty and panic\", a \"systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics\", \"collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline\", deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives, especially credit default swaps, and \"the failures of credit rating agencies\" to correctly price risk. The 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the United States. Critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products, and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets.

{"prompt": "Who had already held a large amount of magisterial offices? Shortly before 312 BCE, the Plebeian Council enacted the Plebiscitum Ovinium. During the early republic, only consuls could appoint new senators. This initiative, however, transferred this power to the censors. It also required the censor to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the senate. By this point, plebeians were already holding a significant number of magisterial offices. Thus, the number of plebeian senators probably increased quickly. However, it remained difficult for a plebeian to enter the senate if he was not from a well-known political family, as a new patrician-like plebeian aristocracy emerged. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because only patricians were allowed to stand for high office. The new nobility existed due to the organization of society.

{"prompt": "The uniqueness of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is due to its high level of what type of molecule? The main cause of TB is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a small, aerobic, nonmotile bacillus.

If a Gram stain is performed, MTB either stains very weakly \"Gram-positive\" or does not retain dye as a result of the high lipid and mycolic acid content of its cell wall.

{"prompt": "What type of dielectric layer is used in electrolytic capacitors? Electrolytic capacitors use an aluminum or tantalum plate with an oxide dielectric layer. The second electrode is a liquid electrolyte, connected to the circuit by another foil plate. Electrolytic capacitors offer very high capacitance but suffer from poor tolerances, high instability, gradual loss of capacitance especially when subjected to heat, and high leakage current. Poor quality capacitors may leak electrolyte, which is harmful to printed circuit boards. The conductivity of the electrolyte drops at low temperatures, which increases equivalent series resistance. While widely used for power-supply conditioning, poor high-frequency characteristics make them unsuitable for many applications. Electrolytic capacitors will self-degrade if unused for a period (around a year), and when full power is applied may short circuit, permanently damaging the capacitor and usually blowing a fuse or causing failure of rectifier diodes (for instance, in older equipment, arcing in rectifier tubes). They can be restored before use (and damage) by gradually applying the operating voltage, often done on antique vacuum tube equipment over a period of 30 minutes by using a variable transformer to supply AC power. Unfortunately, the use of this technique may be less satisfactory for some solid state equipment, which may be damaged by operation below its normal power range, requiring that the power supply first be isolated from the consuming circuits. Such remedies may not be applicable to modern high-frequency power supplies as these produce full output voltage even with reduced input.
