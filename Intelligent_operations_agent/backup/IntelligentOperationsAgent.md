# Customer Operations Agent

## Building an Intelligent Operations Agent for Enterprise OpenShift Clusters

Our operations team faces the challenges of managing a growing number of OpenShift clusters across multiple environments, often dealing with fragmented documentation, recurring incidents, and the need for repetitive troubleshooting. To alleviate cognitive overload and accelerate incident response, we are developing an advanced agent that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for knowledge retrieval, OpenShift control via a Model Context Protocol (MCP), and incident management through Jira integration.

**Vision:**

This agent aims to provide:

* **Intelligent Chat Functionality:** Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language interaction with operations teams.
* **Internal Knowledge Search (RAG):** Accessing and synthesizing information from internal confluence documentation for efficient troubleshooting.
* **External Knowledge Augmentation:** Searching external resources to supplement internal knowledge when needed.
* **OpenShift Interaction (Agent + MCP):** Executing commands and gathering information directly from OpenShift clusters.
* **Automated Incident Response:** Analyzing OpenShift pod logs and events, retrieving relevant solutions via Confluence MCP, summarizing the issue, and creating Jira incidents for tracking and resolution.
* **ServiceNow Integration (Phase 2):** Analyzing existing ServiceNow tickets to identify patterns and provide contextual solutions based on historical incident data.

## Core Capabilities

### Pod Monitoring and Event Analysis
- **Real-time Pod Log Monitoring:** Continuously monitor pod logs across OpenShift clusters to detect errors and anomalies
- **Event Correlation:** Analyze Kubernetes events to identify root causes of pod failures and performance issues
- **Error Pattern Recognition:** Use AI to categorize and prioritize errors based on severity and impact

### Intelligent Troubleshooting
- **Confluence Knowledge Search:** Automatically search internal Confluence documentation for known solutions to detected errors
- **Resolution Recommendations:** Provide step-by-step troubleshooting guidance based on internal knowledge base
- **External Research:** Supplement internal knowledge with external resources when internal documentation is insufficient

### Automated Incident Management
- **Jira Incident Creation:** Automatically create detailed Jira incidents with error details, analysis, and recommended resolutions
- **Incident Categorization:** Properly categorize incidents by severity, component, and impact
- **Escalation Management:** Route incidents to appropriate teams based on error patterns and severity

## Comprehensive Notebook

**`intelligent_operations_agent.ipynb`:**
* **Focus:** Complete end-to-end demonstration of the intelligent operations agent, showcasing all capabilities in a single comprehensive workflow.
* **Capabilities Demonstrated:**
  - OpenShift cluster monitoring and pod log analysis using MCP tools
  - Event monitoring and correlation for root cause analysis
  - RAG-based knowledge retrieval from Confluence documentation
  - External web search for security advisories and best practices
  - Automated Jira incident creation and management
  - ServiceNow historical ticket analysis (Phase 2)
  - Intelligent decision making using ReAct framework
  - Prompt chaining for complex multi-step workflows

* **Complete Workflow Example:**
  1. **Initial Query:** "Monitor pod logs and events in the ai-models namespace in 08d cluster and investigate any issues"
  2. **OpenShift Analysis:** Agent connects to OpenShift cluster, retrieves pod status, logs, and events
  3. **Log Analysis:** Categorizes logs as normal or error, identifies specific issues and patterns
  4. **Event Correlation:** Analyzes Kubernetes events to understand the sequence of failures
  5. **Knowledge Retrieval:** Uses Confluence MCP to search internal documentation for solutions
  6. **External Research:** Searches web for latest security advisories or known issues
  7. **ServiceNow Analysis:** (Phase 2) Reviews historical tickets for similar issues
  8. **Incident Creation:** Creates structured Jira incident with findings and recommendations
  9. **Summary & Next Steps:** Provides comprehensive summary with actionable next steps

* **Advanced Scenarios Covered:**
  - **Pod Failure Investigation:** Complete analysis from detection to resolution recommendations
  - **Security Incident Response:** Integration of security advisories with operational response
  - **Historical Pattern Analysis:** Leveraging ServiceNow data for predictive insights
  - **Multi-Environment Management:** Handling multiple clusters and environments
  - **Automated Escalation:** Intelligent routing and priority assignment for incidents
  - **Event-Driven Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring and response to cluster events

## Key Features

1. **MCP Integration:** Seamless integration with OpenShift, Confluence, and Jira MCP servers for comprehensive cluster management
2. **Jira Integration:** Automated incident creation and management for proper incident tracking and resolution
3. **Confluence Integration:** Direct access to internal knowledge base for troubleshooting guidance
4. **Enterprise Focus:** Tailored for enterprise environments with multiple OpenShift clusters across different environments
5. **ServiceNow Integration:** Phase 2 addition for historical incident analysis and pattern recognition
6. **Security Emphasis:** Enhanced focus on security advisories and compliance requirements
7. **Structured Incident Management:** Automated creation of properly categorized and assigned Jira incidents with appropriate priority levels
8. **Comprehensive Workflow:** Single notebook demonstrating complete operational intelligence capabilities
9. **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of pod logs and events with automated response
